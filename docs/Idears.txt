MECHANICAL:

Characters slightly remember the PC if he has their totem, incurring special dialogue. Dialogue in milestone scenes (and others, maybe) if the PC has char's totem will differ slightly.

STORY:

Fenira and MC hold hands, she accuses him of having sweaty palms, when in reality she's the one sweating a river
