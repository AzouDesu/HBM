Assign no more than 5 affection points (like + love) per character per day. (Minus Prologue/Event Days)
This way, it will take 40 days (or a month) of constant interaction to 
	max out a character
Choosing to hang out with someone will increase like points by 5 and prevent affection decay on that day
Only choices can increase love points
	Usually, certain responses will increase love by one or two points.


Passive like gain
Slight passive love gain


Have 3 categories: Easy, Medium, Hard (Love, maybe Like too)

Easy: Kamao, Viscella, Fenira

Medium: Kumiru, Nagi, Dravenia

Hard: Allise


Some characters approach you, some you have to approach
If you reject a character that approaches you, you have to approach them if you want to try again
One character works up courage - if you turn them down, you have to work your ass off to get it back
Kamao asks ~once a month regardless of love


Eavesdropping/napping gives a multiplier of 3x the points.

if each interaction gives 1 point, and a multiplier gives 3 points...


Two time periods:
	Day and Night

All girls start interested in protag on a simple level (except Allise, who's on a more complex level)
