Assign no more than 5 affection points (like + love) per character per day. (Minus Prologue/Event Days)
This way, it will take 40 days (or a month) of constant interaction to 
	max out a character
Choosing to hang out with someone will increase like points by 5 and prevent affection decay on that day
Only choices can increase love points
	Usually, certain responses will increase love by one or two points.
